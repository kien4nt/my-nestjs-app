# NestJS App Deployment Guide (EC2 + RDS Setup)

This guide walks you through deploying and running the NestJS app on an **Amazon EC2** instance and connecting it to **Amazon RDS**.

## Requirements

- A running AWS VPC instance with at least 1 AZ that has both private and public subnets in Asia Pacific (Singapore) region

- A running AWS EC2 instance which:

  - Contained in a public subnet of the VPC instance
  - Has auto-assigned public IP configured
  - Allows SSH connection from your IP
  - Allows public connection via port 3000

- A running AWS RDS instance which:

  - Contained in the private subnet from the same AZ as the EC2 instance
  - Has RDS CA authorization configured (ap-southeast-1-bundle.pem)
  - Allows only connection from the EC2 instance

- You need to have the private access key file of your ec2 instance stored locally (ec2-key.pem)

## Download RDS CA Certificate from AWS

Go to this URL and download the certificate bundle for Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1-bundle.pem) :\
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions)

---

## Upload RDS CA Certificate to EC2

```bash
scp -i /path/to/ec2-key.pem /path/to/ap-southeast-1-bundle.pem ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>:/home/ec2-user/
```

- Type `yes` to accept the host fingerprint if prompted.

---

## SSH into the EC2 Instance

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/ec2-key.pem ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>
```

- Type `yes` to accept the host fingerprint if prompted.
